# Easy21

## Description

This is the implementation of the Easy21 assignment from the Reinforcement Learning course by David Silver. The assignment is to implement the game Easy21 and then implement the Monte Carlo Control and Sarsa(Î») algorithms and also use Linear Function Approximation to learn the optimal policy for the game.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

The main file of this project is [main.ipynb](main.ipynb). You can run the notebook and see the results of the algorithms.
